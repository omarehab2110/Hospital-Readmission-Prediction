# Hospital Readmission Prediction | AI Project

## Objective
Develop a machine learning system to predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days based on their medical history, treatment information, and demographic details.

## Dataset Overview
- **Records:** 101,766
- **Features:** 50
- **File:** `data/diabetic_data.csv`
- **Target:** `readmitted`  
  - Values: `NO`, `>30`, `<30`
- **Suggested Type:** Multiclass or Binary classification  
  - Binary: Readmitted <30 days = 1, others = 0
- **Data Split:** Not pre-split.  
  - **Recommended:** 80% training / 20% testing using stratified sampling

## ID Mapping File Explanation
Some features use numerical codes which are not human-readable. Use `data/IDs_mapping.csv` to decode them.

- **Columns using mappings:**
  - `admission_type_id`
  - `discharge_disposition_id`
  - `admission_source_id`

**Example from mapping file:**

| admission_type_id | description     |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 1                 | Emergency      |
| 2                 | Urgent         |
| 3                 | Elective       |
| 4                 | Newborn        |
| 5                 | Not Available  |

## Requirements

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and decode IDs using mapping file
- Encode categorical features (label/one-hot encoding)
- Normalize or standardize numerical columns
- Remove or handle outliers

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature distribution plots and correlation analysis
- Investigate relationships between readmission and diagnoses or medications

### Model Development
- Train and compare at least 4 ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Use stratified split: `train.csv` for training, `test.csv` for evaluation
- Use metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC

### GUI Application
- Build using Tkinter or PyQt
- User inputs patient info â†’ get prediction
- Show prediction with confidence score
- Optional: Visual explanations like feature importance

### Final Reporting (PDF)
- Include all preprocessing and model steps
- Present EDA insights and feature impact
- Compare models and tuning strategies
- Final summary of outcomes and insights
