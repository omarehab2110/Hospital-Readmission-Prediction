# Hospital Readmission Prediction | AI Project '25

**Objective:**
Develop a machine learning system to predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days based on their medical history, treatment information, and demographic details.

**Dataset Overview:**
The dataset contains 101,766 records and 50 features.
* File: `diabetic_data.csv`
* Target: `readmitted` (Values: NO, >30, <30)
* Suggested Type: Multiclass or Binary classification (Readmitted <30 days = 1, others = 0)
* Data is not pre-split. Recommended split: 80% training / 20% testing using stratified sampling

**ID Mapping File Explanation:**
Some features use numerical codes which are not human-readable. Use 'IDs_mapping.csv' to decode them.
Columns using mappings: `admission_type_id`, `discharge_disposition_id`, `admission_source_id`
* Example from mapping file:
    ```
    admission_type_id,description
    1,Emergency
    2,Urgent
    3,Elective
    4,Newborn
    5,Not Available
    ```

**Requirements:**

1.  **Data Preprocessing**
    * Handle missing values and decode IDs using mapping file
    * Encode categorical features using label/one-hot encoding
    * Normalize or standardize numerical columns
    * Remove or handle outliers

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    * Feature distribution plots and correlation analysis
    * Investigate relationships between readmission and diagnoses or medications

3.  **Model Development**
    * Train and compare at least 4 ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
    * Use stratified split: `train.csv` for training, `test.csv` for evaluation
    * Use metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC

4.  **GUI Application**
    * Build using Tkinter or PyQt
    * User inputs patient info â†’ get prediction
    * Show prediction with confidence score
    * Optional: Visual explanations like feature importance

5.  **Final Reporting (PDF)**
    * Include all preprocessing and model steps
    * Present EDA insights and feature impact
    * Compare models and tuning strategies
    * Final summary of outcomes and insights
